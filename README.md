# .sbt

My .sbt directory as a GIT project, in order to have a backup and keep track of changes I make.

It currently includes:

- cancellable in Global := true (make tasks cancellable)
- clear command (clears the console, automatically triggered between auto-tests)
- latest sbt-dependency-graph plugin setup
